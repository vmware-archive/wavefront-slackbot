# How to use it

Wavefront slackbot can be invoked using a number of different text
based commands just like you would do with other voice assistants.

Currently supported commands

```
wfbot list alerts
wfbot list alerts for FILTER CONDITION
wfbot list fatal alerts
wfbot list fatal alerts for FILTER CONDITION
wfbot list warning alerts
wfbot list warning alerts for FILTER CONDITION
wfbot list smoke alerts
wfbot list smoke alerts for FILTER CONDITION
wfbot list info alerts
wfbot list info alerts for FILTER CONDITION
wfbot tell me a joke
```

Where FILTER CONDITION is some string you want to filter by.  Assume you
have three alerts firing in Wavefront

```
Kubernetes CPU Usage High
Disk Space Full
High Network Utilization
```

You could then look for these alerts using a command like this

```
wfbot list alerts for Kubernetes
wfbot list alerts for CPU Usage
wfbot list alerts for CPU
wfbot list alerts for Disk Space
wfbot list alerts Network Utilization
```

There are of course a number of ways to apply the filter condition.  As
long as that string is in the alert text then Wavefront Slackbot will
find it as it looks to see if any alerts contain your condition.
